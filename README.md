# Happy Thoughts

This project has been made using:
HTML5, CSS3, React (useEffect, useState, props, form validation etc)

In this app you can post a happy thought and you can like others posts. When you enter your post what you write must be more than 5 characters or less than 140 characters long. When you are either below or above these numbers the button will deactivate and the error message will show. 
You can also press the heart on others/your own post to show them support and like them. 

## The problem

I found this project very fun to work with. It took me a while to get the hang of but when I did I really liked it. I think that React is really fun to work with but when mixing it with Vanilla JS it can be hard sometimes.
